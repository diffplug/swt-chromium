Sometimes Maqetta preview is not showing the correct file. 
Looks like it is a chromium caching issue. 
I patched it on the server side GuiComposerWebServer : "Cache-Control", "no-cache".
 
When Patrick posted a request the Chromium guy confirmed that there is such bug: 
https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=260130
  
After we update we need to check if it has been fixed, and if so, I'll remove the server hack.
