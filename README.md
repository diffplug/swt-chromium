# <img align="left" src="_images/logo_90.png"> swt-chromium: Chromium embed for SWT

This project is dead, because [cefswt](https://github.com/maketechnology/cefswt) is so much better!  Latest Chromium embed for SWT on win/mac/linux under the EPL license, working demos already available.

Please consider donating financially to their project through the Eclipse Foundation to ensure it gets a full SWT Browser API, including javascript interaction.  More details [here](https://github.com/diffplug/swt-chromium/issues/10).
