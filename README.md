# <img align="left" src="_images/logo_90.png"> swt-chromium: Chromium embed for SWT

swt-chromium embeds the latest version of Chromium into the latest version of SWT.  This allows JVM applications to achieve graphical parity with Electron applications.

It isn't yet ready for users, but you can help!  See [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) for info on how to get the dev environment setup.

It is based on CEF3, which is used by both Chromium and the upcoming [Servo browser from Firefox](https://github.com/servo/servo/tree/master/ports/cef).
